## Repository Description:

Cannibals and Missionaries Problem Solver in Prolog

This GitHub repository contains a Prolog implementation for solving the classic "Cannibals and Missionaries" problem. The problem involves transporting missionaries and cannibals across a river, adhering to specific rules to avoid missionaries being eaten by cannibals. The Prolog code utilizes logical programming to represent states, valid moves, and safety checks.

## Key Features:

Logical Representation: States of the problem, initial and goal states, and valid moves are represented using Prolog terms and predicates.
Breadth-First Search: The code employs a breadth-first search strategy to efficiently find a solution path from the initial to the goal state.
Safety Checks: The implementation includes safety checks to ensure that the number of cannibals does not exceed the number of missionaries on either side of the river.

## Usage:
Clone the repository.
Load the Prolog file (cannibals_and_missionaries.pl) in your Prolog interpreter.
Execute the "?- solve." predicate to find and display the solution path for the problem.
